Project Overview
This project presents a next-generation Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) manufacturing model focused on sustainability, cost efficiency, and high performance. It integrates alternative raw materials, waste-derived fuels, renewable energy sources, and AI/IoT-driven automation to reduce CO₂ emissions by 30–40% while improving cement strength, durability, and consistency.

The model is designed to be scalable and commercially viable for modern cement plants while aligning with global sustainability goals.

Key Objectives

Reduce carbon emissions without compromising cement quality

Promote circular economy through industrial and agricultural waste utilization

Improve energy efficiency and reduce fossil fuel dependency

Use AI and IoT for process optimization and quality assurance

Lower production cost per tonne through smart manufacturing

Cement Composition

Clinker (70%)

Limestone: 52%

Clay: 10%

Iron Ore: 2%

Pozzolanic Materials (30%)

Fly Ash: 12%

Rice Husk Ash: 6%

Sewage Sludge Ash: 4%

Glass Waste: 5%

Construction & Demolition Waste: 3%

Nano Additive

Nano Titanium: 0.2% (strength and durability enhancer)

Alternative Fuels in Kiln

Coal: 50%

Plastic Waste (non-recyclable): 20%
